# Scheduled-text-reminder
A program that sends users text message reminders at a desired time. The program evaluates the current weather and serves a reminder to the specified user or users to bring an umbrella or warm/cool clothes before leaving home or the office. The program uses the Twilio API to send a scheduled text and the DarkSky API to get the weather forecast in real time. Created in Python with Jupyter Notebook.
