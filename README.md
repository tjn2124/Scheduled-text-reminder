# Scheduled-text-reminder
A program that sends the user a personal text message at a desired time of the forecast. The program serves as a reminder to bring an umbrella or warm/cool clothes before leaving home or the office. The program uses the Twilio API to send a scheduled text and the DarkSky API to get the forecast in real time.
